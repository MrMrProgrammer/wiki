# 📘 wiki

Welcome to **wiki**, my personal knowledge base and documentation repository.

This repo serves as a **living record** of my experiences, learnings, and best practices as a backend developer and data engineer. Here, I document everything from day-to-day technical insights to deeper architectural decisions, debugging tips, and code patterns I’ve found useful.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Keep track of **technical notes**, **how-tos**, and **lessons learned**
- Build a **personal wiki** for quick reference
- Share my journey, thoughts, and approaches with the community
- Maintain well-organized, categorized content that grows with my experience

## 📂 Topics Covered (and growing!)
- Python, Django, FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- RESTful API design
- Authentication & security (RSA, token systems, etc.)
- Web scraping (Selenium, BeautifulSoup)
- Clean code & architecture (routers, services, logics)
- Linux/Fedora tips and system tools
- AI/ML development notes and data engineering tools

## 🚀 Who is this for?

- Myself (first and foremost — future me will thank present me)
- Junior devs who want to learn by example
- Anyone interested in backend development, data engineering, or real-world debugging

## 🛠️ Notes

This is not a tutorial repo or production codebase — it’s raw, honest, and evolving. Expect a mix of code snippets, configuration files, architecture diagrams, and markdown notes. Most content is written as I encounter problems, so it's practical and experience-driven.
